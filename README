=== ext4fuse ===
This is a implementation of ext4 for FUSE.  A quite limited one, I should say,
but still able to mount my ubuntu 10.04 partition.  The main reason this exists
is to be able to read it from OSX.

Of course, this is only readonly, and it should be safe to use.  In the worst
case scenario you won't be able to mount anything (although I believe that
should work).  Write support is not going to come for some time: first I should
address some design issues, make some tests and get some respectable read
performance.

If you notice a problem, please fill a bug report, preferably with a logfile
attached.  You can use the github tracker:
  * http://github.com/gerard/ext4fuse/issues

You can also drop a mail.  I'd like to know if someone else is using this
besides me.

=== notes about fork ===

So this fork is an ugly hack to mount a "partition" in a full disk dump

=== Usage ===
Compile using "make".  You can mount a filesystem like this:
$ ./ext4fuse /dev/disk0s5 mountpoint [optional-logfile]

You might need to mount a different device depending on how are your partitions
organized.  If you don't know, take a look the Mac Disk Utility.

At least on Leopard, you need to add your user to the operator group so you can
have readonly permissions to the disks.  Use this:
$ sudo dscl . append /Groups/operator GroupMembership <your-user>

=== Limitations ===
 * All code is religiously Little Endian only.  If you don't know what this
   means, you are probably OK (ie, you are using x86 or x86-64).
 * Block numbers over 32 bits aren't supported.  You hit those when you reach
   around the terabyte, and I don't have any way to test that.  It should be
   quite easy to fix, but I don't feel like spending time on something that
   neither has a use for me or can be proved to be correct.  I don't have such
   big disks :P
